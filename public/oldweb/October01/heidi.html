<p><font size="+1" color="#F7301A">Places</font>
<br>I haven't been to too many places, though I'd really like to go to 
<font color="#FCC24B">New York</font>. The place I do like most of all, though, is
<font color="#FCC24B">Tulum</font> in the <font color="#FCC24B">Yucatan</font> (in
Mexico). I think I could live there happily for a while. Of the places I've lived
I love <font color="#FCC24B">Brighton</font> most of all - I was able to make the 
most of it while I was there, and actually had a life (see above). But otherwise, anywhere 
<font color="#FCC24B">lush</font>, <font color="#FCC24B">flower-infested</font> 
and <font color="#FCC24B">rabbit-friendly</font> will do.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1" color="#F7301A">Clothes</font>
<br><font color="#FCC24B">Charity shops</font> are the best places to get clothes. I think of
myself as a <font color="#FCC24B">retroHippySpaceChick</font>.
I'm torn between being a <font color="#FCC24B">hippy</font> or a <font color="#FCC24B">space
 commander</font>, probably not a choice many people face in their lives. I'd like to cruise round
 in my silver boots being very pacifist, although people aren't always understanding. 
</p>
<p>
<font size="+1" color="#F7301A">Things</font>
<br>I love <font color="#FCC24B">wild flowers</font> which most people seem to know as weeds.
They should be left to grow, rather than be mown to shreds every week. My favourites are 
<font color="#FCC24B">daisies</font> and <font color="#FCC24B">montbretia</font>.
I also love <font color="#FCC24B">obscure Japanese tat</font>, especially <font color="#FCC24B">
cartoons</font> and <font color="#FCC24B">fashion</font>. the more <font color="#FCC24B">
hair slides</font> I have, the happier I am (and the more I want).</p>
<p>
<font size="+1" color="#F7301A">Eating and Drinking</font>
<br>Did someone just say<font color="#FCC24B"> Summer Pudding</font>? 
A Homer Simpson style drool will follow. Repeat for <font color="#FCC24B">Frascati</font>,
<font color="#FCC24B">Guacamole</font> and all things <font color="#FCC24B">limey</font>
and that about covers it.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1" color="#F7301A">TV</font>
<br>I have no time for TV. Best. But when I was able to watch it I liked
<font color="#FCC24B">Father Ted</font>, <font color="#FCC24B">The Fast Show</font>
and <font color="#FCC24B">Ali G</font>. I would say I liked <font color="#FCC24B">
Gardening Programmes</font>, but they're all too <i>design</i> and not enough
<i>plants</i>.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1" color="#F7301A">Music</font>
<br>Here's a list of people and musical-things I like, and my fave songs by them:
<ul type="circle"><li type="circle"><font color="#FCC24B">Belle and Sebastian</font> - <i>
Get me away from here, I'm dying</i>, and <i>Seeing other People</i></li>
<li type="circle"><font color="#FCC24B">Stephen Duffy</font> - <i>
You've got to love</i>, and <i>Sugar High</i></li>
<li type="circle"><font color="#FCC24B">The Go-Betweens</font> - <i>
Right Here</i> and <i>Love Goes On!</i></li>
<li type="circle"><font color="#FCC24B">The Beloved</font> - <i>
Outer-Space Girl</i> and <i>Found</i></li>
<li type="circle"><font color="#FCC24B">Funky Dance Music</font> - <i>
Rock Da House</i> by Tall Paul
was my favourite for ages</li>
<li type="circle"><font color="#FCC24B">Fatboy Slim</font> - in the old days</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<font size="+1" color="#F7301A">Kitsch</font>
<br>I love all kitsch, but most of all <font color="#FCC24B">70s retro</font>.
I find Charity Shops are the best places to find my favourite things, the truly revolting
<font color="#FCC24B">brown and orange</font> plastic items. My best buys so far are
a set of <font color="#FCC24B">imitation wood egg cups</font>, and my beloved
<font color="#FCC24B">orange tube lamp</font>.
</p>
<p>
<font size="+1" color="#F7301A">Books</font>
<br>I really enjoy <font color="#FCC24B">John Irving</font>'s books, which is handy
as Duncan keeps reading them to me in the evenings. Other than that, I like a lot
of modern fiction, though not the sort of book with a title based on the current most popular
girls names. I really liked <font color="#FCC24B">Nyphomation</font> by <font color="#FCC24B">
Jeff Noon</font> but not his other books so much, and I also like much of <font color="#FCC24B">
Martin Amis</font>' writing.</p>
