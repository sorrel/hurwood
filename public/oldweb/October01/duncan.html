	<p>He works for a company in the daytime, and in the evenings and weekends tries to entertain his

	<p>He has been to university twice, first at <font color="#F5FA58">Sheffield</font> and then at

<font size="+1" color="#5757F9">Things</font>
<br>It's very easy to list favourite things and leave them to define a cultural shape for you. But
favourite things are never the same for very long. What matters is not so much <font color="#F5FA58">
what</font> you like, but <font color="#F5FA58">why</font> you like it. 
Not that I'm going to explain myself very well.
</p>
<p>
<font size="+1" color="#5757F9">Books</font>
<br>I'm currently reading  <font color="#F5FA58">The Fourth Hand</font>
by <font color="#F5FA58">John Irving</font>, but I'm not enjoying it as much as some of his earlier books. I'd recommend
<font color="#F5FA58">The Cider House Rules</font> as one of his better books (but not the film).
<p>Favourite books? My copy of <font color="#F5FA58">Shelley, The Pursuit</font>, the biography by <font color="#F5FA58">Richard Holmes</font>
travelled a long way with me, and was read many times, in the 1990s. You can find a very over-referenced poem about Shelley
<font color="#F5FA58"><a href="duncpoem.html" STYLE="text-decoration: none">here</a></font>.
I'm also a big fan of popular science books, and consider 
<font color="#F5FA58">The Diversity of Life</font> by
<font color="#F5FA58">Edward O. Wilson</font> a wonderful introduction to an ecological view of the world. 
</p>

<p>
<font size="+1" color="#5757F9">Football</font>
<br>To enjoy football, you need to <font color="#F5FA58">invest</font> in it. Just watching a 
match costs a lot of money, especially in the higher leagues, and there are numerous other ways 
you can spend your cash in a display of devotion to particular team.
<br><br>
But to really enjoy football, you need to put in some <font color="#F5FA58">emotional</font> investment.
The more you <font color="#F5FA58">care</font> about one team winning, the happier it'll make you feel
when they do. But once you let them in, it leaves you vunerable to the prospect of disaster. And suddenly
football starts to <font color="#F5FA58">matter</font> more than anything else. The teams I really care
about are <font color="#F5FA58">Brighton and Hove Albion</font> and <font color="#F5FA58">England</font>.
<br><br>Everyone should follow a football team for a year or two, and experience the agonies it can give you.
And everyone who follows football should take a year off, and get 
a sense of perspective for at least one season.  
</p>

<p>

<font size="+1" color="#5757F9">Games</font>
<br>Half the fun of being all grown up is being able to play games whenever you want. The trouble is, the more
responsibility you have, the more you feel you should be doing something <font color="#F5FA58">constructive</font>
instead. Back in the days when when <font color="#F5FA58">leisure time</font> was more than just a nice idea, 
I liked to enjoy <font color="#F5FA58">video games</font>. 
<p>Expressing a liking for video games is like 
saying you enjoy music - it doesn't say very much at all. As a teenager I loved playing <font color="#F5FA58">
Defender</font> on the <font color="#F5FA58">BBC Micro</font>. More recently, I've loved <font color="#F5FA58">Panzer
Dragoon Saga</font> on the <font color="#F5FA58">Sega Saturn</font>, and <font color="#F5FA58">Zelda</font>
 and <font color="#F5FA58">Goldeneye</font>
on the <font color="#F5FA58">Nintendo 64</font>. The best video games have yet to be made.
</p>
<p>
<font size="+1" color="#5757F9">Music</font>
<br>I'm still singing along to the <font color="#F5FA58">The Mutton Birds</font>, this time to the more Autumnal 
<font color="#F5FA58">Envy of Angels</font>:
<blockquote><font color="#F5FA58">They're painting the signs
<br>Measuring the land, marking the lines
<br>Laying foundations, making it strong
<br>For all of those people
<br>Who haven't been born</font></blockquote>
Also finding its way from the stereo into my tuneless singing, are the 
<font color="#F5FA58">pet shop boys</font>, and their very yellow <font color="#F5FA58">Bilingual</font> album. I rap along with Neil Tennant, singing:
<blockquote><font color="#F5FA58">Dreaming is easy, life is tough
<br>I got the picture
<br>The most important thing
<br>is not to end up bitter
<br>'cause when you start to feel
<br>increasingly forlorner
<br>- woomph! - love comes
<br>right around the corner
</font></blockquote>
Anyone who rhymes <font color="#F5FA58">corner</font> with <font color="#F5FA58">forlorner</font> can do no wrong. 
If I had to name a favourite album and single (which of course, I shouldn't really) I'd say 
<font color="#F5FA58">16 Lovers Lane</font>, by 
<font color="#F5FA58">The Go-Betweens</font> for the album, and 
<font color="#F5FA58">She's a Star</font> by <font color="#F5FA58">James</font> for the single.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1" color="#5757F9">Comics</font>
<br>Or as some people say, <font color="#F5FA58">Graphic Novels</font>. I not really bothered what you call them,
 but what I do like is the ones written by <font color="#F5FA58">Peter Milligan</font>. He's written the very
 wonderful mini-series <font color="#F5FA58">Enigma</font>, <font color="#F5FA58">The Minx</font>,  
 <font color="#F5FA58">The Extremist</font> and <font color="#F5FA58">Egypt</font>, and the almost
 as wonderful long running series <font color="#F5FA58">Shade, the Changing Man</font>. 
 Never as popular as Neil Gaiman, or Alan
 Moore, but so much more fun. I've done a small page about comics 
 <a href="dunccomic.html" STYLE="text-decoration: none">here</a> - loading size is 283K!</p>
<p>
<font size="+1" color="#5757F9">Films</font>
<br>I don't like many films, but the last good one I saw was <font color="#F5FA58">
Festen</font> a Danish film directed by <font color="#F5FA58">Thomas Vinterberg</font>.
I'd say my favourite film is <font color="#F5FA58">Jules et Jim</font> directed
by <font color="#F5FA58">Fran&#231ois Truffant</font>.</p>
