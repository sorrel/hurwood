	A comic is like a storyboard for a very expensive film. With films there is a budget, and
	constant attention has to given to how the picture is to be achieved.
	With comics all that's needed is an artist good enough to realise the
	pictures in the writers head. 
	<br><br>
	There are two types of comics - limited runs of short stories (unusually from 1 to 8 issues), 
	and ongoing series that continue until the sales fall too low. While the first type is more 
	focused, the second has the freedom to explore a great deal further than the original conception.
	<font color="#00CCFF">Shade, the Changing Man</font> was a moderately successful ongoing series.
	
	<br><br>
	There were 72 issues of <font color="#00CCFF">Shade, the Changing Man</font> - from 1990 to 1996. 
	Judging by the vast interconnected world of comics, the character probably existed as part
	of the <font color="#00CCFF">DC Universe</font> in some previous incarnation. I have no idea.
	<br><br>What I do know, is that after a slightly dodgy start, the series built into a whole
	much greater than the sum of it's parts. It was written by <font color="#00CCFF">Peter Milligan</font>.
	<br><br>The picture on the left is drawn by <font color="#00CCFF">Rian Hughes</font>.
	<br><br>At the end of this page I've reproduced the <font color="#00CCFF">last page</font> of

	<font color="#00CCFF">The Sandman</font> started in 1987, and ran for 75 issues until 1996.
	Hugely popular, it is unique amongst comics in that it ended for artistic, rather than financial
	reasons. It is also unique in that while 75 issues long, it follows a linear plot with very little
	padding. 
	<br><br>
	The central character is <font color="#00CCFF">Morpheus</font>, which certainly gives 
	imagination the chance to run riot. With dreams, you can ignore any normal conventions - though
	the strength of the story is that it builds up an entirely unnatural and unbeliveable, but 
	consistent, world.
	<br><p></p>Or maybe I just like it because it sets 
	<font color="#00CCFF">A Midsummer-Night's Dream</font> in <font color="#00CCFF">Wilmington</font>.
	  
	<br><br>
	Whatever, it remains very popular, and there are probably hundreds of web sites devoted to it.

	<font color="#00CCFF">Egypt</font>, apart from being a word I find impossible to spell, 
	was a mini-series of 7 issues, by <font color="#00CCFF">Peter Milligan</font> (again). 
	<br><br>
	It is a story of outrageous co-incidences (like all the best stories), 
	set in a far future that wants to be the past.
