<br>I read the above book rather too much in the 1990s, and wrote a poem about it. Trying to stuff references
to the book in every line doesn't improve it. Can you spot them all?
</p><br>

<font size="+1" color="#00CCFF">to settle my account</font>
<blockquote><font color="#F5FA58">the fear of pursuit kept us awake
<br>with delight at the thought
<br>at what we had done; their
<br>arms full of bundles and eyes open wide
<br>as we get to the harbour
<br>and for the first time
<br>can see that my promise
<br>is all they require</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#00CCFF"><blockquote>(the tracks we left behind
<br>were notes that I must credit
<br>with providing revolution
<br>and shelter from this weather)</blockquote></font>
<font color="#F5FA58">the crossing was rough, it kept us awake
<br>as we huddle together
<br>on the top deck; the passengers laugh
<br>with the crew at their jokes
<br>and look over us slowly
<br>as if we don't know
<br>the way that their thinking
<br>increases the cold</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#00CCFF"><blockquote>(forming a community
<br>was all we entertained
<br>like a party of assassins
<br>we illuminate the way)</blockquote></font>
<font color="#F5FA58">the landing was easy
<br>and together, arm in arm
<br>we walk across the sandbank
<br>and saw the work begin
<br>from a carriage to the building
<br>while reports of other storms
<br>charged tyranny with passion
<br>and put scars upon the wall</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#00CCFF"><blockquote>(I will face them without flinching
<br>and set fire to all my boats, will
<br>draw electricity from fingers
<br>and will never let you go, I will
<br>be honest with my feelings
<br>dear sister of my soul
<br>for it's better to burn constantly
<br>than not to burn at all)</blockquote>
</font>
<font color="#F5FA58">I will contain these violent storms
<br>and will wrap them up in cloth
<br>that wraps around your skin
<br>and pulls us both along;
<br>I will negotiate a loan
<br>so these words will not be lost
<br>that will fill our sails with wind
<br>and leave our bodies strong
<br><br>
and will give it to the world
<br>to do the things I promise</font>
<br><br>
</font></blockquote>
