<p>She has just learned to walk, and is enjoying the new freedom it gives her. 
</p><p>She is also learning to talk. Her first word was <font color="#80FF00">star</font>.<p></p>
Now she knows many more words, like <font color="#80FF00">chocolate</font> and 
<font color="#80FF00">chips</font>
which we tried to stop her learning, without success.</p>
<p>Below is a summary of Indigo's current thinking:</p>
