Dawkins arrived at our house at the end of October 1998. He travelled
in a cardboard box, with his new friend <a href="../chico/chico.htm">Chico</a>.
Dawkins is seen here just after he left his hutch, and saw his new
home for the first time.

<p>
He is only about eight weeks old in this photo, so he's a little bigger now.

painted their names on it in case they got lost, and didn't know where
they lived.

They also have a run, or ark, which they inhabit on occasion.<br>
We painted it yellow, so that they could both have
a running theme in their lives, and would feel more secure (or at least, slightly important).

<p>It can be seen here on another sunny day.
