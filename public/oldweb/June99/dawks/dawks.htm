Dawkins is a rabbit that lives with us, in a hutch in the garden.
He has an elevated position. He is a black Netherland Dwarf 
rabbit, and hops (when allowed) around our garden.

<p>Dawkins has a happy life (we hope), and is particularly keen
on not getting caught. This is usually when we're about to go
out and have to put him back into the hutch. Gently he hops
away from our outstretched arms. He never goes far away, but he's
always just out of reach. Dawkins rather brief <a href="dwphoto.htm">photo collection</a>
is now on-line.



<p>Dawkins is named after <A HREF="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/bios/dawkins.html">Richard Dawkins</A>.
