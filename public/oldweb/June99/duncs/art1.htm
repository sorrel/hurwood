<p>This page is devoted to one of my favourite artists - <b>Harald Sohlberg</b>.
If you haven't heard of him - don't worry, not many people have. He was from Norway 
and lived from 1869 to 1935, making him a contemporary of the much more famous 
Edvard Munch. There are four of his paintings reproduced here, with a few brief
notes of my own. I'm not an art critic (as you may soon gather) so don't expect 
any revelations. The paintings are:

<ol>
<li><A HREF=#sol1>Summer Night</a>
<li><A HREF=#sol2>Flower Meadow in the North</a>
<li><A HREF=#sol3>Night</a>
<li><A HREF=#sol4>Winter Night in Rondane</a>
</ol>

This was, for a long time, my favourite painting.

<p>It is a view of Norway, painted from a house to the south-east of Oslo.
<p>The reproduction here doesn't do it justice - to fully appreciate the
blue in the sky you need to see the original, in the National Gallery in Oslo.

This painting is also concerned with the Nordic night, and the presence of humans
in the landscape.<br><br>
Although the only direct signs of human habitation are the two buildings on the left,
their mark can be seen in the sharp contrast between the flower meadow, and the other
cultivated land.<br><br>
This painting is also in the National Gallery, Oslo.<br>

This painting shows the church in the town of R&#248ros.<br><br>
Like the previous paintings on this page, this is painting is also 
concerned with two distinct worlds. This time, the contrast is most strongly
between the graves in the foreground, and the houses in the background.<br><br>
This painting is in the Trondheim Art Gallery.<br>

This is the most well-known of Solhberg's paintings, and was the product of revelation
similar in style, but opposite in content, to Munch's <i>shriek</i>.<br><br>
He painted many versions of this scene, which can be found in lots of galleries around
Norway. If you go to Bergen, you will find my favourite one.<br><br>
This one is from the National Gallery, Oslo.<br><br>
