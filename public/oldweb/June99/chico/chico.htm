Chico is our guinea-pig. He lives with Dawkins in
the hutch at the back of our garden. He has only one
mission in life - to be scared. It doesn't matter
what happens in life, there's one thing we can all
be sure of - that Chico will be frightened of everything.

<p>Chico does have one other feature. His brain. Or, rather, 
his <i>lack</i> of a brain. For Chico is thick. And that
doesn't mean that he's just mildly stupid - no, Chico
is quite possibly one of the thickest mammals ever
to have inhabited the surface of the planet. If I didn't know
better I'd've thought that Chico is a pretty good proof
of the existence of God. It seems inconceivable that anything
so stupid could have <i>evolved</I>.<br><br>
Chico is named after

Chico Mendes</A>. The irony of this is not lost on us.
