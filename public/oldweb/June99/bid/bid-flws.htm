Although I do love wild flowers I don't
actually do with them what I'm doing in the
drawing. Remember kids, it's not big or clever
to rip them out of the ground, and
throw them over your head (while dancing).
It doesn't help them very much. 


I love wild flowers because they grow everywhere
(apart from concrete places), and because
there's <b>so many</b> different kinds.

I used to find all the ones pictured here around
Burgess Hill, in Sussex, when I went walking there.
These were all in the fields around the shetland
ponies and shetland foals that I fed apples to. These
are my favourite three wild flowers at the moment -
Cowslip, Harebell and Scarlet Pimpernel.
