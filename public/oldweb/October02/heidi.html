<p><font size="+1" color="#7CE463">Hi Heidi. How are you doing?</font>
<br>I'm alright. Can't complain. Much.</p>

<p><font size="+1" color="#7CE463">How's your day been?</font>
<br>Busy. Tiring. I went to playgroup. With the children.</p>

<p><font size="+1" color="#7CE463">What are you looking forward to?</font>
<br>Holiday and hedonism. Asher's birthday. A more financially stable situation.</p>

<p><font size="+1" color="#7CE463">What's your favourite word?</font>
<br>Caress, plinth.</p>

<p><font size="+1" color="#7CE463">What's your favourite journey?</font>
<br>Along woodland paths to a meadow on a hill, in the orange glow of the evening sun, with wildflowers
and rabbits.</p>


<p><font size="+1" color="#7CE463">When and where were you happiest?</font>
<br>The 29th of February 1996, in Brighton.</p>


<p><font size="+1" color="#7CE463">If you could live anywhere, where would it be?</font>
<br>By the sea, somewhere Mediterranean.</p>


<p><font size="+1" color="#7CE463">What do you think of the first three Assignments of Sapphire and Steel (late 70's, early 80's TV Programme)?</font>
<br>Dire. Plodding. Bad outfits. The only good thing is the retro furniture.</p>


<p><font size="+1" color="#7CE463">What are you reading?</font>
<br>Wuthering Heights, and Gardening Books.</p>
