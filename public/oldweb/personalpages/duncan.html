		<h2>Alternative Australian Bands</h2>
<p>
Without consciously meaning to, I seem to have quite often become a fan of a number of Australian and New Zealand bands. I didn't have a plan to enjoy obscure music that others haven't heard, but somehow following my own tastes always seems to take me back 'down under'.
</p>
<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan7_1.jpg" width="300" height="218" alt="A picture of the Go-Betweens 2005" /><p class="infotext caption">The Go-Betweens</p></div>
<h3>The Go-Betweens</h3>
<p>
were from Brisbane, which I used to imagine as somewhere exotic and slightly dangerous, like Marrakech when William Boroughs lived there. Further research has not backed this theory up.</p>
<p>
Whatever their background, I loved the music of <em>The Go-Betweens</em> since the first day I heard it. I'd been aware of them in the late 1980s, but never quite got round to buying any of their records. But on a lovely Spring morning in Eastbourne in 1990, I saw the cover to their <em>1978-1990</em> compilation, and bought the record on impulse.
</p>
<p>
<em>The Go-betweens</em> started recording in the late 1970s, and I don't like their initial post-punk angular stylised recordings. They lack everything that their later records are brimming with: an almost, but not quite, lush warmth and stories of almost, but not quite, successful love.
</p>
<p>They split up in 1990, but there were several solo records made by the individual members (Grant McLennan and Robert Forster) in the 1990s. Without an internet, and no knowledge of the music 'scene' (or even if they were 'in' it) I used to scour through record shops in case either of them had released a new record. Grant McLennan's records were poppy and sweet, but without ever becoming cloying, while Robert Forsters' were a little darker, but with the subtle tones of human relationships within the lyrics. I never met anyone else who had heard of them, but it didn't stop me enjoying the music.
</p>
<p>
In 2000 they began to release records under the name <em>The Go-Betweens</em> again. In their previous incarnation their popularity had not been a major feature of their existence, but things began to change at this point, and it became possible to meet others who had heard of them. Their 'comeback' records were the equal of anything they'd previously done. My daughter was born in 2000, and if my daughter has a 'song', it is probably <em>Spirit</em> from the album of that year:
<blockquote>
You're one thing greater<br />
Than all the things<br />
You are together
</blockquote>
say the lyrics, and it works for me. They released a couple more albums, of increasing quality, and I got to see them in concert a few times, including their 2004 Barbican show where they played with a string section. They're not really a Barbican band, the architecture of the venue was at odds with the spirit of the music, but it was lovely to be there.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, Grant McLennan died earlier this month, and so <em>The Go-Betweens</em> story has ended. Their popularity at the end was such that he had obituaries in The Times and the Independent, and a large public funeral in Australia. He wrote the favourite songs of both my children: <em>Finding You</em> (Asher), and <em>Streets of your town</em> (Indigo), and it's very sad that there will never be another Go-Betweens record. 
</p>
<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan7_2.jpg" width="300" height="293" alt="A picture of David McComb 1994" /><p class="infotext caption">David McComb</p></div>
<h3>David McComb</h3>
<p>
was the lead singer of the the Australian band <em>The Triffids</em>. They were from the country around Perth, and unlike <em>The Go-Betweens</em> the landscape of their country seems to filter directly into the music.
</p>
<p>While Australia can be seen as the land of surfing, beer and barbies, in the songs of David McComb it is the land of desperation, with the empty distances and heart of the country contrasted with dreams of those within it.</p>
<p>The band was very popular in Scandinavia, and it's not hard to see why. Take away the temperature, and cabin-fever is the same whatever the weather; and cabin-fever is it the heart of much of the music made by <em>The Triffids</em>.</p>
<p>I first heard them in 1988, while being driven round in a friends car:
<blockquote>
It's been a hell of a summer<br />
to be lying so low,<br />
</blockquote>
says one of their early songs, the antitheses of the imagined Australian dream. Their 1980s records mix stories of claustrophobia, heat and drinking with the concept of an endless road - one that never quite gets to a destination - but would could be wonderful if it did.
</p>
<p><em>The Triffids</em> split up in 1989, and David McComb released a couple of singles, and one magnificent album in the 1990s: <em>Love of Will</em>. Like much of <em>The Triffids</em>, the album is full of christian imagery, though I'm not convinced the writer was actually religious. David McComb died in 1999, and my ambition from way back in the late 1980s to see him in concert can never happen.
</p>
<h2>New Zealand</h2>
<p>In the 2000s I've enjoyed two other groups, both of whom are from New Zealand.
<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan7_3.jpg" width="300" height="236" alt="A picture of the Finn Brothers 2004" /><p class="infotext caption">The Finn Brothers</p></div>
<h3>The Finn Brothers</h3>
<p>
are by some distance the most famous artist on this page. They were in a group called <em>Split Enz</em>, which I must admit I've never heard, and in another called <em>Crowded House</em> which were also very popular, though again I don't know much about them apart from some of the singles and the last album: <em>Together Alone</em>.
</p>
<p>But it isn't in their most successful moments that I admire them; instead the two albums, which in my estimation are way above anything else they've done, are <em>Finn</em>, from 1995 though I didn't hear it until 2004, and <em>Everyone is Here</em> from 2004.
</p>
<p><em>Everyone is here</em> is  an album from an adult point of view, and I certainly wouldn't have appreciated the sentiments on it in my early twenties. I can't say I like every song on it, but if playing a song a lot means it's your favourite, then the song <em>Won't Give in</em> is my favourite song from the last few years:
<blockquote>
What does it mean<br />
When you belong to someone<br />
When you're born with a name,<br />
When you carry it on<br />
</blockquote>
say the lyrics, and the answer is in the melody and expression of the singing. If I have sentimental moments over my family, then it's to the soundtrack of this song.</p>
<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan7_4.jpg" width="300" height="234" alt="A picture of the Don McGlashan" /><p class="infotext caption">Don McGlashan</p></div>
<h3>Don McGlashan</h3>
<p>was the lead singer with the New Zealand band <em>The Mutton Birds</em>. Unlike the other bands on this page, who I first heard on record then spent many years trying to see in concert, I saw <em>The Mutton Birds</em> in concert before I knew any of their records, in Bath in the Autumn of 1998.
</p>
<p>Now that I know the songs I'd love to see them in concert again, but as they split up in 2000, it probably won't happen.</p>
<p>Unlike some of the other bands on this page, Don McGlashan's songs are not based on anything other than songwriting: he doesn't try to project his own personality through the music, and so I have no idea what he is like, or what his opinions are. And, of course, it doesn't matter: what matters are the songs.
</p>
<p>The songs of <em>The Mutton Birds</em> are like short stories; they explain something, usually from one point of view, while the music fills in the emotional depth. In <em>White Valiant</em>, the narrator picks up someone whose car has broken down, but the song remains ambiguous as to the intentions of the rescuer, with the music filling in the gaps like a dark cloud overhead.</p>
<p>My favourite song is probably <em>Last Year's Shoes</em>, with the lyrics:
<blockquote>
There's a thin strand of Winter inside<br />
This long Summer hillside<br />
No matter how hot it gets<br />
<br>
There's something new about you<br />
A thin strand of Winter in you<br />
Something that wasn't there before<br />
</blockquote>
but almost all the songs are of the same quality. Another favourite, and close as my wife and I get to having "our" song, is <em>While You Sleep</em>, from the 1996 album <em>Envy of Angels</em>:
<blockquote>
Summer flowers<br />
Shimmering down the street<br />
Plastic sandals on your feet<br />
In the doorway<br />
You looked so hungry<br />
You couldn't stand still<br />
You made everything in the flat<br />
Look so cheap<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>The good news as far as I'm concerned is that Don McGlashan has just released a new album, called <em>Warm Hand</em>. It has received good reviews in New Zealand, but also seems to only be available there. As I write this my copy should be on the way to England. I hope I like it.</p>
<h2>A place I've never been</h2>
<p>I don't know why all my favourite bands and singers seem to be people with Scottish ancestors who come from Australia and New Zealand. Maybe it's the attraction of the other, the unknown, in the lyrics. But it is my pop soundtrack of the 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
