			<h1>Asher's <em class="title">Page</em></h1>
			<div class="infotext">Page last updated on the 4th of June 2006</div>
		</div>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>This page is Asher's page. This time he requested it be concerned with a number of themes that are currently close to his heart.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="asha6_1.jpg" width="400" height="275" alt="Van Gough Painting" /><p class="infotext caption">Long Grass with Butterflies</p></div>
		<h2>Long grass with butterflies</h2>
<p>This is a painting that Asher wanted on his website. When asked why, he said "<em>I like the green bits</em>", and was unaware that butterflies also feature in it.</p>
<p>However, Asher also has a history with the painting, as it is the only public work of art that Asher has tried to destroy. We saw it in an exhibition recently, and Asher wanted to point something out on the picture (maybe he had seen the butterflies after all), and rushed towards it. Before we could stop him he jabbed his finger into the picture, which caused it to shake, and the security guards to close in around us. Luckily everything survived the altercation, and the picture has not been harmed. And nor were we, or Asher.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="asha6_2.jpg" width="400" height="414" alt="Asher in armour" /><p class="infotext caption">Armour</p></div>
		<h2>Armour</h2>
		<p>When asked why he wanted armour on his website, Asher said "<em>It's very shiny</em>." He added that the particular armour pictured here "<em>has a shield with it, that's very shiny. That's the shiniest</em>!"</p>
		<p>Asher enjoys all weapons and armour, and loves swordfighting. He wants to wear full-size armour one day.
		</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="asha6_3.jpg" width="400" height="484" alt="Asher's rabbit friend" /><p class="infotext caption">Murco</p></div>
		<h2>Murco</h2>
		<p>Murco is Asher's favourite soft toy, and sleeps with him every night. As such, he is one of Asher's most favourite things.</p>
		<p>When asked what he likes about him, Asher said "<em>It's really because he's so soft</em>."</p>
		<p>On occasion Murco has been lost, and during those fraught times Asher has been worried. When asked about how he felt when Murco was lost, Asher said "<em>He did be lost, but then he came back again</em>." We hope he is not lost again.</p>
		<p>For those who want slightly more information, we can inform you that Murco comes from the city of Wells, and is not named after a petrol-station chain, but instead due to a mispronounciation of <em>Myrtle</em>, Indigo's old favourite toy rabbit. Asher believed that "Myrtle" was what all rabbits were called.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="asha6_4.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Asher and a mechanical thing" /><p class="infotext caption">Mechanical Things</p></div>
		<h2>Mechanical Things</h2>
		<p>Asher loves all mechanical things that <em>do something</em>. When asked about why he liked the one pictured here he offered: "<em>They open and closes</em>."</p>
		<p>He added that there were many parts that made them interesting: "<em>Because you like the blue bits, and the black bits and the cable on it</em>".</p>
		<p>Asher also intimated that mechanical objects can be useful in challenging situations: "<em>Whoever's stuck in gates I can open, and they can easily get out</em>."</p>
		<h2>Doctor Who</h2>
		<p>Doctor Who is Asher's new favourite thing. There will be more about that next edition.</p>
