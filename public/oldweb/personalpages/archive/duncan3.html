		<p>This is Duncan's page. Last time it was full of athletic deeds, so he feels he has earned a rest this time. </p>

		<h2>Winter</h2>
		<p>It's now winter, and while I often find the <em>idea</em> of Winter quite appealing, the reality never seems quite able to match up. Maybe it's the way my umbrella always gets pulled inside out during rainstorms, or the way my shoes leak, but it just doesn't live up to the imaginary Winter that probably was created by reading "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" when I was young. The <a class="textlink" href="http://www.marcalmond.co.uk/greenroom/hos.htm">new Marc Almond album</a> tries to live in a slightly different Winter: a Russia where the winter fields go on forever, and are full of solitary figures lurching nobly on towards their lost love. Like <a class="textlink" href="http://website.lineone.net/~ssiggeman/chp/">Childe Harold</a> meets <a class="textlink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/m/montypythonsflyi_1299002137.shtml">Monty Python</a>. It's a good album though, in parts.</p>
		<h3>A day out in London</h3>
		<p>At the start of Winter we had a family day out in London, which almost (but not quite) resulted in a special edition of this website. We enjoyed the <a class="textlink" href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/eliasson/">Olafur Eliasson exhibition</a> at the Tate Modern, especially as it enabled us to lie down, but still see where our children were running off to. Indigo liked the <a class="textlink" href="http://www.londonaquarium.co.uk/">London Aquarium</a>, but I don't think it's worth the admission price. We went to the Natural History Museum too, but Asher's favourite thing was going on a bus, which he still enjoys telling everyone about.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan3_2.jpg" width="300" height="196" alt="A picture of some weeds underwater, which I've borrowed from another website" /><p class="infotext caption">Some calming weeds in a stream</p></div>
		<h2>The return of <a class="textlink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2003/09_september/26/dr_who.shtml">Doctor Who</a></h2>
		<p>I thought I should mention this, as everyone else does. However, as no-one knows anything about it, there really isn't very much to say. Hooray, and all that, and then nothing. So I thought that this calming picture of some underwater weeds in a stream might be a charming alternative to unwarranted speculation. Though looking at it does make me begin to wonder if they'll do a re-make of <a class="textlink" href="http://www.gallifreyone.com/episode.php?id=rr">Fury from the Deep</a>...</p>
		<h2>Any other business</h2>
		<p>Everyone tends to make resolutions to start the new year, but we've decided not to do that. Oh no. That would be far too obvious. Instead the plan is to quietly get on with things, tip-toeing round the big ideas, and act as if we don't care. Then, when the ambitious plans think we're not paying them any attention, when they feel free to relax and start thinking about where they'd like to go on holiday - <em>we Strike</em>! We'll sidle right up beside them as they're idly flicking through the brochures, and, before they know it - they shall be our prey!</p>
		<p>At least, that's the plan.</p>
