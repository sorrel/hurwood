		<h2>Art Attacks!</h2>
		<p>Heidi was astounded to discover that her local lake had been taken over a by a crack-team of art terrorists during December.</p>
		<h3>Amazement</h3>
		<p>When Heidi first passed the lake, she was amazed. She had never guessed that close to where she lived was another conceptual artist - like herself - who could make meaningful art out of what other people considered to be simply worthless rubbish. Heidi, 23, who earns her living as a model, artist, sculptor and gardener and <em>still</em> finds the time to bring up two happy children, had always considered her neighbourhood full of the type of people who buy <a class="textlink" href="http://www.upmystreet.com/inf/msc/det/?l1=bs137ah">tinned steak</a>. Instead, she now sees art where once she saw decay.</p>
		<h3>Driving</h3>
		<p>Heidi, whose hobbies include visiting charity shops and buying any old tat and telling her husband that it's rare 1970s retro artwork, had previously considered misplaced motor vehicles an unsightly blot on the landscape. Now she realises that they are, in fact, art. "<em>I wish I had known earlier</em>," she is quoted as saying, "<em>because I now realise that my driving is very artistic</em>."</p>
		<h3>Rubbish</h3>
		<p>Heidi also likes to turn her home into one continuous work of art. She can take virtually any old rubbish, and once she's covered virtually every single inch of the walls at home with it, it is miraculously transfigured into art.</p>
		<h3>But it is rubbish</h3>
		<p>When informed that the car in the lake was not, in fact, art, but instead just normal mindless teenage vandalism Heidi was no longer available for comment.</p>
