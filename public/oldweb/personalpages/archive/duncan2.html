			<h1><em class="title">Duncan's</em> Walk</h1>
			<div class="infotext">Page last updated on the 11th of September 2003</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>On the 7th of September I took part in the 40 mile walk <a class="textlink" href="http://www.acoventryway.org.uk">A Coventry Way</a>. My experiences of the day are shown below. Please note that as the whole day could be condensed into the words "<em>walk</em>" and "<em>pain</em>" the descriptions below are somewhat superfluous. I am not the world's most athletic person.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan2_1.jpg" width="230" height="207" alt="At the starting line" /><p class="infotext caption">Sunday Morning, Early Dawning</p></div>
		<h2>Up at 4:30 on a Sunday morning</h2>
		<p>I got up at 4:30 and had three shredded wheat for breakfast. It just seemed like the right thing to do in the circumstances. At 5:15 I took a taxi to Meriden. The only traffic on the road seemed to be other taxis; probably more walkers off to the start, I thought. It made me feel better to think like that.</p>
		<p>As we neared the pub, we passed a cyclist, who I later saw waiting at the start of the race. I don't know how he got on during the walk, but I'm glad I didn't have to cycle home after it was over.</p>
		<p>It was cold at the pub, and I had to put on my raincoat for warmth. All the other walkers seemed to have torches, and I sat in the dark holding my sheet of paper with additional instructions for the day, hoping that dawn would arrive quickly. I began to have fears that I was somehow under-prepared for the whole event.</p>
		
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan2_2.jpg" width="230" height="110" alt="Just before Sunrise" /><p class="infotext caption">If nights fails, can day be far behind?</p></div>
		<h2>Off we go</h2>
		<p>As we started three or four people sprinted away into the twilight, and I never saw them again. As I didn't know the way, and it was a bit too dark to read the map clearly, I followed the main bunch of people off into the Warwickshire fields. I hoped they knew where they were going.</p>
		<p> Before long the sky began to brighten, and with the walking I soon became warm enough to take off my coat. I then carried it around the rest of the way, but it never rained. I knew this would happen, from the moment I decided to take the thing with me. The forecast had promised rain from around four in the afternoon, and I was worried that it might arrive a few hours earlier. But taking the coat ensured I'd never need it.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan2_3.jpg" width="180" height="185" alt="Up comes the sun" /><p class="infotext caption">It's just the sun rising</p></div>
		<p>After two and half miles I had my first experience of walking through an area of nettles while wearing shorts. In this case they were next to a field of maize, and for a while I experimented with walking between the rows of the maize. The plants were covered in dew, and it soaked through my top across my arms and shoulders. The fields beyond had a low mist in them, and I started to think of American horror films for a while.</p>
		<p>By now there was only one person in view ahead, and two or three in the distance behind. As we approached three miles the sun rose, and my clothes started to dry off. The sun was a very welcome sight, and the conditions became just right for walking quickly. There were a number of very surprised-looking cows and horses in the fields I went through. They probably weren't used to seeing so many insane humans in such quick succession. I took some photos of the horses to show Indigo, as she always wants to know how many horses, foxes or rabbits I've seen when I've been walking. (For the record, the numbers on Sunday were many, two and about twenty.)</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan2_4.jpg" width="230" height="179" alt="Kenilworth railway line" /><p class="infotext caption">The path became a blur</p></div> 
		<h2>Full speed to Kenilworth</h2>
		<p>Soon I reached the disused Kenilworth-Berkswell railway line, and I marched as quickly as possible down the line. I knew the way from here to Ryton, and was happy to put my map away and just concentrate on walking fast.</p> 
		<p>I was overtaken by a couple of joggers, but the one person left behind me vanished into the distance, and I didn't see anyone else for ages.</p>
		<p>There were a few rabbits on the path, who rushed off when they heard my stomping feet approaching. The sun had risen a bit higher by now, and made a lovely dappled green in the sheltered walkway. I ran past Crackley Wood, just to show I still could, and emerged out into Kenilworth.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan2_5.jpg" width="100" height="236" alt="Kenilworth Checkpoint" /><p class="infotext caption">Kenilworth</p></div>
		<p>The first checkpoint was at the end of Common Lane, where it meets Dalehouse Lane. After a minute or two I hurried off up the hill to the golf course. The golf course was empty at around eight in the morning, and the ground still had a thick layer of dew. In the distance I thought I saw a number of other walkers heading off in the wrong direction, but I wasn't sure. There wasn't anybody ahead when I left the golf course, but there was someone about three hundred metres behind, so maybe they got lost among the greens and bunkers. I'd walked through the golf-course many times before, but had never seen it empty of golfers.</p>
		<h2>On to Bubbenhall</h2>
		<p>After Kenilworth the path went through a field with an electric fence in the way, and I rolled under it. I took my long-sleeved top off after that, and ran across the bridge over the A46, and then walked on to Stoneleigh. I started to feel a few twinges in my right leg at this point (about 11 miles), and decided to go faster, so that I would at least have got a bit further by the time it started really hurting. In retrospect this may not have been the best decision I made all day.</p>
		<p>The sun was getting higher in the sky, and the dew disappearing from the grass by the time I arrived at Bubbenhall. I hadn't looked at my map since starting the railway line before Kenilworth, and had forgotten there was a checkpoint at the village hall, so at first I thought it was unconnected to the walk, and almost ignored it. By this point I could feel a definite twinge every time I pushed off with the right foot, and I stopped for about five minutes and had a lot of water.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan2_6.jpg" width="100" height="250" alt="Bubbenhall" /><p class="infotext caption">Bubbenhall</p></div>
		<p>The organisers had a map of the whole walk set up in the village hall car park, and I was dismayed to realise I'd only done fourteen and a third miles. I decided that the distance between fifteen and twenty-file miles would be the crucial one, and after refilling my now empty water bottle, I set off on the wide path to Ryton.</p>
		<h2>The road goes ever on: Towards Wolston</h2>
		<p>Nearly a mile towards Ryton my leg started to really hurt, and walking along by the row of Lombardy Poplars at the end of the wide path from Bubbenhall I began seriously to think that I wouldn't make the distance. I found climbing over the style difficult, and stopped for a minute to re-group my energies.</p>
		<p>At Ryton the path went through the middle of the Peugeot Factory car park. Row upon row of new 206's stood waiting to take their new owners on a journey of ease and comfort. I hobbled past them, looking at the barbed wire that separated us.</p>
		<p>After going through the A45 subway I had to get my map out again, as I didn't know the way on from this point. I saw no-one ahead of me, and could no longer see anyone behind me either. The map gave me a bit of hope, as I saw my target not as the seemingly impossible forty miles at the end, but just Wolston, just under two miles away. I had done nearly seventeen miles of the walk.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan2_7.jpg" width="120" height="104" alt="Ryton Car Factory" /><p class="infotext caption">Peugeot Factory</p></div>
		<p>Going down the hill after leaving Ryton was the point at which each step of my right foot became painful. I felt I could no longer walk like I had been before, and my left leg had to do all the work, while my right leg became more of a passenger. I walked on it, but couldn't push off with any force. At the bottom of the hill I had to walk through two ploughed fields, and on the second one walked unwittingly too far along the hedge, missing my exit. I turned back to see three other people walk past me on the correct way, and started to walk back across the very uneven ground. This was probably my lowest point of my walk, as every other step was painful, and having gone the wrong way meant each step was also pointless.</p>
		<p>As I limped into Wolston, I was overtaken by two runners. The runners started much later than the walkers, and seeing them rushing into the distance ahead was quite off-putting. Finally, after much misery on my part, I reached the checkpoint at Wolston: Eighteen and half miles in.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan2_8.jpg" width="100" height="264" alt="Wolston Checkpoint" /><p class="infotext caption">Wolston</p></div>
		<h2>Vintage Cars: Wolston to Bretford</h2>
		<p>At Wolston was a table set out with a variety of food and drink, and a radio playing <em>Test Match Special</em>. Civilisation indeed. The first few checkpoints hadn't tempted me with their pieces of orange, but suddenly they now looked somehow more enticing. I stopped a few minutes, and with England at 594 for 8, set off again.</p>
		<p>Walking out of Wolston, I decided that if I were to make the distance I needed to be more disciplined in my walking, as limping another twenty one miles was unlikely to be the best way of getting to the end. I began to concentrate on following a beat of "1,2,3,4". I found that if I increased my speed gradually I could get quite a fast walk going, and following a set pattern seemed to make the pain ease off.</p>
		<p>Looking ahead on the map I could see a bus shelter marked on the way in to Bretford, and I resolved to make for there, as I hoped it would have a seat. It seemed like a good target to aim for anyway. Maybe a bus would arrive. A couple more runners ran past me, and there were two walkers just ahead, and another one still about three hundred metres behind.  I walked past one of the many River Avon's of England, and saw the Swans enjoying lazing about on the water. It looked a pleasant kind of lifestyle.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan2_9.jpg" width="200" height="174" alt="Swans past Wolston" /><p class="infotext caption">River Avon past Wolston</p></div>
		<p>As I approached the bus shelter, I could see a variety of cars on the pavement and grass. People had parked their cars, and were sitting with fold-away tables having picnics while watching a parade of vintage cars go by, all part of <a class="textlink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/features/stories/2003/08/car-run-2003-schedule.shtml">The Coventry Car Run</a>. Many decorated Triumph Heralds, flying the English and Union Flags, drove past as I marched on over the bridge at Bretford. Not wanting to appear lame in front of so many people, I put on a determined face, ignored my plans for sitting down for a little rest, and walked on to the bridle path towards Brinklow.</p>
		<h2>Mind over nettles: On to Brinklow</h2>
		<p>As I climbed the hill towards Brinklow I realised I had passed the half-way point of the course. I felt much better now than at any time since Bubbenhall, and found the well packed ground easy to walk on. I wished the rest of the walk would just be this path, but that wasn't to be.</p>
		<p>Arriving on the outskirts of Brinklow, the path went into a very unevenly ploughed field. After struggling across it, I couldn't find the way to get to the path at the edge. Nettles blocked the way, some nearly waist high. However, I considered wading through nettles more preferable to walking back across the ploughed field, and so walked through them all, wishing I had longer trousers on. As I passed the last nettles I had to climb over a large pile of branches, and fell down the other side. However, the pain from the nettles and fall seemed to cancel each other out, and so I carried on.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan2_10.jpg" width="200" height="139" alt="Remains of a Norman Castle" /><p class="infotext caption">Remains of a Norman Castle</p></div>
		<p>At Brinklow I climbed up to the sides of the old Norman Motte and Bailey, and changed my socks. At this point the walker who had been behind for many miles finally passed me. There was a checkpoint at Wolston, but I forgot to ask them to take my photo for this website. I was too busy enjoying slices of orange.</p>
		<h2>A Sunday stroll along the Oxford Canal</h2> 
		<p>Leaving Wolston I quickly got into a determined walk again, and found the going fairly easy in comparison to the ploughed fields and nettles. As I approached the Oxford Canal I overtook some other walkers, whose entire family appeared to have arrived in an estate car full of food and drink. I enjoyed a couple of free jaffa cakes, and climbed down to the canal towpath.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan2_11.jpg" width="250" height="108" alt="The Oxford Canal" /><p class="infotext caption">The Oxford Canal</p></div>
		<p>The canal took up miles twenty-three and half to almost twenty-six. I was passed by a few runners, but saw no other walkers. I walked under the M6, and before I was expecting it the canal walk had ended. I had to climb down the sides of the Hopsford Aqueduct, discovering in the process that I couldn't step down with my left leg first as it was then too painful to bend the right leg second. Walking towards Ansty I was overtaken by more runners, and saw another walker catching me up. Determined not to be too slow, I resolved to stop him passing me for as long as possible, and with that inspiration, strode on.</p>
		<p>The walk rejoined the Oxford Canal briefly, before heading across some ploughed fields on the side of the M69. At Barnacle, someone on the side of the route was providing refreshments from their garden, and I had a very welcome glass of orange squash. I had done around twenty-eight miles, and the weather seemed to be very hot.</p>
	<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan2_12.jpg" width="100" height="277" alt="Bedworth" /><p class="infotext caption">Bedworth</p></div>
		<h2>The topless tower of Bedworth</h2>
		<p>Beyond Barnacle the fields seemed to merge into one. As I got closer to Bedworth I tramped across a ploughed field with a football pitch on the far side. It was a children's game, and the touchlines were full of parents yelling encouraging and occasionally angry words at their children. What they made of the walkers striding past them I don't know; by this time my vision was fixed on the next objective: Bedworth. I'd never thought of it as a place to visit before, but I now wished I could be in it right away.</p>
		<p>The walk into Bedworth led a short distance along the Coventry Canal. A man fishing with his son asked me how far I'd walked, and why so many people were walking and running past. It felt a great relief to say I'd done thirty miles, and for the first time realised that there was no way I wasn't going to complete the walk. Thus encouraged I walked up the disused railway line into Bedworth.</p>
		<p>It was strange to see people in Bedworth wandering around without rucksacks or running shoes on, but in an instant I passed between countryside and town. At the checkpoint the walker who had been around 300 metres behind me for several miles finally caught me up, as I stopped for extra oranges.</p>
		<p>I walked on, following the streets around under the shadow of the water tower. While each step remained painful on my right leg, once I had managed to get up a good walking speed I could still cover the ground quite fast. The tower shrunk behind me, and I walked through a new and unfinished housing estate out of Bedworth.</p>
		<h2>When Maize Attacks: 32 to 35 miles</h2>
		<p>I hadn't considered the walk beyond Bedworth. In my preparations I hadn't even looked at the map there, assuming that if I got that far things would sort themselves out somehow. There were three walkers a few hundred metres ahead of me, and to my benefit I watched them go the wrong way up a field covered with full-grown maize, and then turn back and go on the right way.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan2_13.jpg" width="100" height="295" alt="37 Miles" /><p class="infotext caption">37 Miles</p></div>

		<p>Maize was not my friend. On one field the farmer had cut a path through the maize, but left about a foot of stalks sticking up out of the ground. These were all pointed down the hill I was to climb, and they wouldn't budge if accidentally kicked. This meant I had to lift my feet over them on every step. The field was large, sloping upwards, and a nightmare. My left leg started to get twinges too, and my gait became comedic as I tried to stride onwards. Another field of maize followed, this time with the path so narrow I was bashing into the crop every other step. But at least it wasn't just ankle high anymore!</p>
		
		<p>Just before the checkpoint at thirty-four miles, I was passed by a last group of runners. The three walkers ahead of me started to pull away, and I couldn't keep up the pace with them any longer. But I was very happy to see the Jelly Babies on offer at the checkpoint, and I stopped for a couple of minutes. After this, for the last six miles, I didn't see another person until the finish.</p>
		<h2>The Final End: The last six miles</h2>
		<p>Not long after setting off again, near Corley Ash, I became unsure of the route. I walked down one path through a spinney, and then worried that I'd taken the wrong turn, went back and took another. By this time both legs had started to hurt, so instead of pain every other step I now experienced a new interesting sensation of pain in both legs on <em>every</em> step.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan2_14.jpg" width="230" height="169" alt="Woods north of Meriden" /><p class="infotext caption">Woods north of Meriden</p></div>
		<p>The good news was that it was downhill all the way back to the M6, but I could no longer bend my right leg at all. It was probably quite funny to watch, though not quite so entertaining to participate in. At thirty-six miles I went over the M6, on a strange wide bridge that had brambles and steps at both ends. A sign on it said "<em>No Vehicles over 20 Tons</em>", though how the lorries could have climbed the steps to get on it I'm not sure.</p>
		<p>At the last checkpoint I felt somewhat adrift of modern civilisation, and was happy I had been born into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries rather than the 18th, and have to walk everywhere. The last three miles were pretty much agony every step, though they did pass through some very lovely woods about a mile north of Meriden.</p>
		<p>After going under the A45 the last steps back to Meriden were not quite the fastest I have ever walked. I finished in <em>12 Hours, 12 Minutes and 45 Seconds</em>. I had hoped, with about three miles to go, to finish in under 12 hours, but the last three miles took much longer to walk than the first five had.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan2_15.jpg" width="200" height="278" alt="The End" /><p class="infotext caption">40 Miles. Woo!</p></div>
		<h2>Home</h2>
		<p>When I got back home (thanks to Simon for the lift!) I was able to reflect on the walk, and the plans I had for doing it.</p>
		<p>After hearing about the walk at the Godiva Festival, I wondered whether or not I could walk forty miles. I had a go at the walk to see whether or not I could do it - as I had no idea what walking forty miles was really like.</p>
		<p>For the eight or so weekends before the walk I practiced walking between twelve and twenty-five miles. I had a painful right leg on more than half of those practice walks, and knew it was likely to be a real problem on the walk. I was hoping that it wouldn't start hurting until twenty-five miles, and was very disheartened that when the pain kicked in at fifteen miles, a lower distance than on all my practice walks. I think this happened because I walked so fast between miles three and fifteen.</p>
		<p>As for giving up, it wasn't something that I considered doing. For a while I didn't think that I would actually get to the end, but while I could still walk another step I intended to keep going.</p>
		<h2>Was it worth it?</h2>
		<p> I think so, as it's always good to have a go at a challenge. I'm glad I did it. If I were to do it again I think I would prefer to walk with someone else.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan2_16.jpg" width="190" height="278" alt="Back home" /><p class="infotext caption">Happy to be home</p></div>
		<p>Thanks are also due to Heidi for making me food for the day, and sending me many encouraging text messages full of things along the lines of: "<em>He strides on!</em>" and "<em>You can do it!</em>". Indigo and Asher enjoyed seeing me get back home, and instantly demanded I play jumping games with them, which I politely declined. I'd also like to thank the organisers of the walk, who did a wonderful job with their checkpoint refreshments, and of course the excellent map. The hard work they did was appreciated.</p>
		<p>I hoped to spend some time thinking about literary things while on the walk, but had to concentrate on just moving for most of the time. But I did think of Shelley's <em>Ode to the West Wind</em>, the last lines of which I've reproduced below:</p>
		<p><em>Be thou, Spirit fierce,   
<br />My spirit! be thou me, impetuous one!   
<br />
<br />Drive my dead thoughts over the universe,   
<br />Like wither'd leaves, to quicken a new birth;   
<br />And, by the incantation of this verse,
<br />
<br />Scatter, as from an unextinguish'd hearth   
<br />Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!
<br />Be through my lips to unawaken'd earth
<br />  
<br />The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,   
<br />If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind? 
</em></p>
