		<p>This page is Asher's space, which he can fill with whatever he chooses. As he's still not brilliant at articulating what he wants at the moment, we've chosen a few topics for him.</p>

		<h2>The cold</h2>
		<p>Asher is not a fan of the cold. Even when wrapped up with many layers, with mittens firmly tied onto his hands, and with a nice thick hat he can only cope with about fifteen minutes of cold weather. After this he is always keen on a return to somewhere warm, as soon as possible.</p>
		<p>To help Asher we got him a huge <a class="textlink" href="http://www.michelin.com/portail/index.jsp?langue=FR">Michelin Man</a> style all-in-one winter cover, which seemed to work. Below Asher says a few words about his feelings for cold:</p>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: How did you like it when it was cold?</p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: I've got a saw.</p>
		<p><em>Asher attempts to saw the table with his plastic saw.</em></p>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: Did you like the cold?</p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: Yeah. And I put on glubbies.</p>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: Would you like to be in a hot place, or a cold place?</p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: And hot and cold. And glubbies.</p>
		<p><em>Asher continues to saw.</em></p>
		<h2>Christmas</h2>
		<p>Christmas 2003 was the first Christmas that Asher was aware of. He soon got the hang of demanding presents and chocolate, and enjoyed the new books and toys that he received. We asked him how he felt about Christmas:</p>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: Did you like Christmas?</p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: Alright. A Christmas prellent. I'm going upstairs. I like driving car. Driving car woo woo woo.</p>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: What did you like best at Christmas?</p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: I like Christmas prellent.</p>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: And what don't you like?</p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: I don't like Christmas prellent.</p>
		<h2>Songs</h2>
		<p>Asher finds great enjoyment in songs, so we asked him about his favourites:</p>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: What songs do you like?</p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: (sings) Daddy's got one hammer, one hammer, one hammer, Daddy's got one hammer all day long.</p>
		<p><em>Asher rhythmically hits Daddy with a toy hammer many times.</em></p>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: And any other songs?</p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: (sings) Daddy's got two hammers, two hammers, Daddy's got two hammers all day long.</p>
		<p><em>Asher continues to assault Daddy, but is then distracted by Daddy writing down the conversation.</em></p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: I want to do writing.</p>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: What other songs do you like?</p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: (sings) Baa Baa Black Sheep have you any wool. Yes sir yes sir, three bags full.</p>
		<p><em>Asher takes more tools out of his toy tool kit, and gives Daddy a nut and bolt set.</em></p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: You do it. Oh. Broken.</p>
		<p><em>Daddy unscrews the toy nut and bolt.</em></p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: (sings) Round and round roundabout.</p>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: Is there any special message you'd like to send to the world?</p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: I want to do key. I want to lie down.</p>
		<p><em>Asher hides under a blanket, and the interview is concluded.</em></p>
