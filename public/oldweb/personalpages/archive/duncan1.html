			<h1><em class="title">Duncan's</em> Page</h1>

		<p>This page is where Duncan puts his thoughts across.</p>

		<h2>The new design</h2>
		<p>At the moment I'm happy that just to have finished the re-design of the website. The decision to offer two stylesheets more or less doubled the work, but at least now they're finished. I'm not sure it was worth it, but I certainly learnt about stylesheets.</p>
		<h2>Why the <em>fern</em>?</h2>
		<p>Each of our pages in the new webpage has it's own symbolic item. I expect these will change over time, but for now I've got a <em>fern</em>. Fern's are my favourite plants; possibly this may be seen as slightly old-fashioned as flowering plants have been around for at least 120,000,000 years, and even newcomers like grasses have been here for 30,000,000 years - but I do like ferns. Moss is nice too, but not so easy to draw.</p>
		<h2>Walking long distances quickly</h2>
		<p>This is something I'm doing at the moment, in the hope that I'll manage to complete the 40 mile <a class="textlink" href="http://www.acoventryway.org.uk">Coventry Walk</a> in September. It's not certain I'll do it yet - the 25 mile walk I'm doing one day soon will be the test that tells me whether I can make it.</p>

		<h2>Cultural Things</h2>
		<p>I'm currently reading a book called "The Closing of the Western Mind: The Rise of Faith and the Fall of Reason", by Charles Freeman. <a class="textlink" href="http://homepages.which.net/~radical.faith/reviews/freeman.htm">Here's a review</a> of the book from a Christian website. I'm not religious, but I don't have a problem with people whose religion means they wish to go round being nice to other people.</p>
		<p>Having children tends to mean you don't get the chance to go out to the cinema as much as you would like to. With the advent of DVDs we're replacing the cinema with classic television programmes, and are gradually working our way through the best of the 60s, 70s and 80s. Recently I've enjoyed <a class="textlink" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006G9VS/qid%3D1057604839/202-4146914-8060623">I Claudius</a>*, and <a class="textlink" href="http://www.btinternet.com/~screeny/features/edgedark.htm">Edge of Darkness</a>. I'd certainly recommend them to anyone (except maybe those who feel like they need cheering up).</p>
		<div class="infotext">*Please note that this link to Amazon.uk does not constitute any form of endorsement. I certainly do not get any money from the link; I just couldn't find any other decent reviews of the DVDs. Maybe I've not looked hard enough.</div>
