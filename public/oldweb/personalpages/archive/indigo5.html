			<div class="infotext">Page last updated on the 16th of June 2005</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>Indigo would this time like to present a few of her favourite things. These now consist of Princesses and Mermaids.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="indigo5_1.jpg" width="300" height="491" alt="Indigo's next to Snow White" /><p class="infotext caption">"Indigo next to Snow White"</p></div>
		<h2>Aurora</h2>
		<p>Indigo is a particular fan of <em>Aurora</em> (pictured further down the page). Indigo was asked to say a few words about her:</p>
		<p>"<em>I like her dress, and her tiara. She's the fragile princess because her stand keeps breaking - it had to be sellotaped on.</em>"</p>
		<p>At this point, we should point out that Indigo is talking about her cardboard cut-out version of <em>Aurora</em>, and not a <i>real</i> princess.</p>
		<p>Indigo continues: "<em>Don't move her too much or as she'll fall over. She needs to be leant against things.</em>"</p>
		<p>When asked to comment further on why she liked Aurora best of all, Indigo continued:</p>
		<p>"<em>I really like her tiara, and her bag and dress. And she's holding a flower; a rose.</em>"</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="indigo5_2.jpg" width="300" height="579" alt="Aurora" /><p class="infotext caption">Aurora: The Fragile Princess</p></div>
		<h2>Snow White</h2>
		<p>Snow White is another popular princess. Indigo likes:</p>
		<p>"<em>Her basket of flowers, and I like her dress and her hair.</em>"</p>
		<h2>Ariel</h2>
		<p>Ariel is a particular favourite of Indigo, as she is both a princess, and a <em>Mermaid</em>:</p>
		<p>"<em>Ariel lives under the sea, and King Neptune is her father. I like her because she has loads of jewellery. Look at this one, it's got diamonds in the middle of it!</em>"</p>
		<p>Indigo is pointing out both some of Ariel's jewellery, and some of her own that she stores in her Ariel-themed music box (pictured below).</p>
		<p>"<em>This one glows under the covers - it lights up when you twist it. And it goes round my neck; it's a necklace.</em></p>
		<p>Indigo demonstrates her iridescent seahorse necklace for some minutes, and Daddy makes many admiring noises about how wonderful it is.</p>
		<p>"<em>Do you like glow in the dark things? I do. I love this necklace.</em>"</p>
		<p>Daddy asks if Indigo has any more sea-related information to share:</p>
		<p>"<em>I have a lot of mermaids and sea creatures. I don't like squid, though.</em>"
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="indigo5_3.jpg" width="300" height="339" alt="Ariel" /><p class="infotext caption">Ariel, in the guise of a music box</p></div>
		<p>Indigo notices that one of her multicoloured starfishes has fallen off the wall, and proceeds to stick it back up again.</p>
		<p>"<em>I've got my very own blu-tack; look, it's keeping the poster up, and these little starfish with eyes. Once, when I was ill I lay in bed, and all the starfish fell off, and some of them lost their eyes. Mummy was here too, and saw it. But the blu-tack keeps them on the wall now.</em>"</p>
		
		<p>Daddy asks if Indigo has any other Princess or Mermaid related information she wishes to impart:</p>
		<p>"<em>I like their jewellery, and dresses. I want to sleep like a princess.</em>"</p>
		<p>At this point, the starfish that Indigo had re-stuck on the wall with blu-tack, fell off again, and Indigo descended into giggles.</p>
		<p>The interview was therefore concluded.</p>
