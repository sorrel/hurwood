			<h1>Asher's <em class="title">Train Page</em></h1>
			<div class="infotext">Page last updated on the 6th of February 2005</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>This page is Asher's page; like Asher it is mostly at the moment concerned with trains at the moment.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="asha4_2.jpg" width="320" height="284" alt="A picture of Henry"  /><p class="infotext caption">Henry: He is loved</p></div>
		<h2>What I like about Trains</h2>
		<p>Due to Asher's current fascination for <a class="textlink" href="http://www.randomhouse.com/kids/thomas/">Thomas the Tank Engine</a>, we decided to ask Asher a few questions about Thomas, and other associated trains:</p>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: You like these trains quite a lot, don't you. Which ones are your favourites?</p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: I like "Henry". And "Diesel 10".</p>
		<p><em>Asher shows Daddy a number of pictures and books about Henry.</em></p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: I like their smiley faces.</p>
		<p><em>Asher points out a number of engine portraits, all involving faces that are smiling.</em></p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: I like "Thomas the Tank Engine". I like "Percy". I like the helicopter.</p>
		<p><em>Asher points out to Daddy more train related pictures.</em></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="asha4_1.jpg" width="200" height="251" alt="A picture of the Fat Controlle"  /><p class="infotext caption">The Fat Controller: Too Fat</p></div>
		<h2>What I don't like about Trains</h2>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: But you don't like everything about the trains, do you?</p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: I don't like the "Fat Controller". He's too fat.</p>
		<p><em>Asher points to a picture of the Fat Controller.</em></p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: I don't like him!</p>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: Anything else that's not the "Fat Controller"?</p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: I don't like engines going fast. And I don't like faces going "ooooooo".</p>
		<p><em>Asher points out a pictures of a train going "oooooo", which has been added to this page, so we can all understand what Asher dislikes.</em></p>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: Is that everything you don't like?</p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: I don't like cars, I don't like buses. Buses go fast and have too many loud noises. But I like aeroplanes. I would go on an aeroplane. I'm being a train!</p>
		<p><em>Asher makes arm movements to indicate motion, but doesn't move.</em></p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="asha4_3.jpg" width="200" height="258" alt="An 'oooooo' face"  /><p class="infotext caption">An "ooooo" face: disliked</p></div>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: Are you a slow train?</p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: I'm stuck in the mud.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>Other Things</h2>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: Moving on from Thomas to other things you don't like, you're not very good at eating food are you?</p>
		<p><em>Asher makes a face of disgust, and starts wiping away non-existent food from his fingers.</em></p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: I don't like it when it gets all over my fingers. I don't like messy fingers.</p>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: That's what we have cutlery for.</p>
		<p><em>Asher nods.</em></p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: Ummmm.</p>
		<p><em>Asher wipes imaginary food off again.</em></p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="asha4_4.jpg" width="320" height="302" alt="Henry and the tunnel picture" /><p class="infotext caption">A book Asher recommends</p></div>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: I like serviettes. I would eat dinner with a serviette.</p>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: Well, you can.</p>
		<p><em>Asher nods.</em></p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: I would like something to eat now. I would like to eat something that's in a bowl that's yellow.</p>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: Erm, ok. Did you mean a yellow bowl, or yellow food?</p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: I would eat crisps in a bowl.</p>
		<p><em>Daddy</em>: A yellow bowl?</p>
		<p><em>Asher nods several times.</em></p>
		<p><em>Asher</em>: Ummmm.</p>
		<p><em>Asher starts to leave, heading for the crisps he imagines will soon arrive in a bowl that may, or may not be yellow; though maybe it was the crisps all along.</em></p>
		<p><em>And the interview is concluded.</em></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="asha4_5.jpg" width="320" height="318" alt="Asher's bedroom wall"  /><p class="infotext caption">Asher and his Thomas the Tank Engine Wall</p></div>
		<h2>The Thomas the Tank Engine Wall</h2>
		<p>By his bed, Asher has pictures of the trains he likes.</p> 
		<p>After waking up in the night and being somewhat upset about pictures he didn't like (for example, trains going "oooooo" or pictures of the Fat Controller), the pictures are now all Asher friendly.</p>
		<p>The wall, and the owner of the wall are pictured here together.</p>
		<p>In addition to this, Asher has a wooden train track, a large number of Thomas the Tank Engine books, and some annuals from the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
		<p>The prospect of any new Thomas-related product greatly excites him, and is occasionally used as bribery to persuade him to eat healthy food. But he draws the line at carrots, for some not entirely fathomable reason.</p>
