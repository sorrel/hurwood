		<h2>Spring</h2>
		<p>Spring seems to have arrived.</p> 
		<p>Blossom can be seen on the trees at the end of our road that may, or may not, be a variety of Malus.</p> 
		<p>(I've been trying to learn to identify each common species of tree, but it's not that easy before the leaves arrive. Those who know better can write in and tell me.)</p>
		<p>I've reading about climate issues recently, and one thing interests me is the inability of people to spot long term trends when living through a period of change. While it's easy to spot when something is there one day, and gone the next, minute changes are often ignored even when they lead to major changes.</p>

		<h2>Does this matter?</h2>
		<p>Two questions follow from this: are things changing; and does it matter if they are?</p>
		<p>In <a class="textlink" href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/bios/diamond.html">Jared Diamond</a>'s book (pictured left) <a class="textlink" href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/politicsphilosophyandsociety/0,6121,1391335,00.html">Collapse: How Societies Choose To Fail Or Survive</a>, the subtle change over time is one of the four reasons given for failure of societies to survive.</p>
		<p>A summary of the reasons given in the book are:</p>
		<ul class="shift"><li>The inability for societies to see that actions may cause harm in the future.</li>
		<li>The inability to perceive changing circumstances, when change happens over the long term.</li>
		<li>Failure to address known problems, or to change ingrained habbits to solve them.</li>
		<li>The inability to solve problems, even when they are fully understood, because they are beyond the capacity of the society to solve.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Changes caused by climate change are not easy to spot, as they occur over the long term. It may be that the blossoming in early February of the particular tree pictured above would have been unusual one hundred yerars ago. But as each year is always different from the next, it is difficult to tell, and harder still to prove.</p>

		<h2>Phenology</h2>
		<p>Phenology (says the Shorter Oxford Dictionary) is "the field of study that deals with cyclic and seasonal natural phenomena, especially in relation to climate and plant and animal life".</p>
		<p>As climate change has become fashionable, so the study of the timing of seasonal change is increasing. <a class="textlink" href="http://www.woodland-trust.org.uk/">The Woodland Trust</a> is conducting a country wide study this year, found at <a class="textlink" href="http://www.phenology.org.uk/">www.phenology.org.uk</a>.</p>
		<p>With the information provided by surveys like this, the extent of any change will easier to quantify. The effects, though, will only become obvious after they have happened.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan5_2.jpg" width="250" height="392" alt="Brian Fagan Book" /><p class="infotext caption">How Climate Changed Civilization</p></div>
		<h2>The Long Hot Summer</h2>
		<p>While Jared Diamond's <em>Collapse</em> included ecological factors as contributory to the sudden decline of some civilizations, <a class="textlink" href="http://www.archaeology.org/0405/reviews/summer.html">The Long Hot Summer: How Climate Changed Civilization</a> by <a class="textlink" href="http://geography.berkeley.edu/ProjectsResources/CaliforniaThinkers/profiles/fagan.html">Brian Fagan</a> looks solely at how climate has affected the rise of civilization.</p>
		<p>The book considers a number of pre-historic communities, and considers these in conjunction with the climate records of that time.</p>
		<p>In particular, it concentrates on climate changes that can be seen in the records, but which were almost certainly not directly observed by the people who lived through them. If a period of "drought" lasts more than one hundred years, people will not be aware of it as such; instead it will be the normal situation.</p>
		<p>Problems may come if cultural practicies that evolved in times of more plentiful water supply continue during the time of drought.</p> 
		<p>Many actions are done for historical rather than practical reasons, and at the time of the earliest civilizations agricultural methods based on a vanished climate could literally lead to the death of the society.</p>
		<p>Whether this situation has its parallels in modern society is not known. It may be that modern industrial society is contributing towards a climate that will not prove beneficial to its long-term survival; But it also may not be the case at all.</p>

		<h2>The Long Goodbye</h2>
		<p>Looking at things from a long term perspective, the worst event (or more probably, series of events) to affect the planet was at the end of the <a class="textlink" href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/permian/permian.html">Permian</a> age.</p>
		<p>Other than the <a class="textlink" href="http://www-eps.harvard.edu/people/faculty/hoffman/snowball_paper.html">Snowball Earth</a> theories, no other event is thought to have had such a devastating effect on life on this planet.</p>
		<p>The causes of the <a class="textlink" href="http://www.uky.edu/KGS/education/EndPermian.htm">Permian Extinction</a> do not have the same level of consensus as the end Cretaceous event. The book <a class="textlink" href="http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/essays/tls2003.html">When Life Nearly Died: The Greatest Mass Extinction of All Time</a>, by Michael J. Benton does not attempt to provide a conclusive answer.</p>
		<p>What the book does do is show the evidence points to <a class="textlink" href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9805317Hotinski_etal_2001.pdf">anoxic conditions</a> existing in the seawaters of the time. While the cause of this remains open to interpretation of the evidence, it seems likely that a huge volcanic erruption and subsequent warming of the planet may have been to blame.</p>
		<p>It is possible that the current warming trends may result in a similar sequence of events. Undoubtedly this would take several thousand years, but it may be that it is already under way. The detail obtained from the phenological study, and from the early blossom could be seen in the future as pieces of evidence of the change.</p> 
		<p>But here, stuck at the start of the twenty-first century, we cannot know any of this for certain.</p>

		<h2>Gradual changes on a smaller scale</h2>
		<p>Not all environmental change involves the scale of global climate change. Over time the character of many things changes, but those who perceive them on a daily or even yearly basis may not notice.</p>
		<p>Hedges were mostly introduced when common land was enclosed, and so are mainly a product of the 17th to the 19th Century. What annoys me about hedges is not so much when they're removed, but instead when they are destroyed through over-zealous maintanence.</p>
		<p>Modern cutting equipment can make short work of the toughest of hedge trees. Hedges are usually cut back once a year, to the same dimensions as the previous year. The problem with this is that the hedge is often unable to regenerate fast enough to do the job it's meant to: i.e. it's no longer thick enough to be a hedge.</p>
		<p>When this happens, fences are brought in to replace that section of the hedge. Over thirty years or so, this can destroy hedges, but as with as with many changes that take place gradually over many years, the change is not obvious to those who see it every day.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="duncan5_3.jpg" width="300" height="246" alt="Put Picture Here" /><p class="infotext caption">A hedge with a tree on the left</p></div>
		<h2>Gradual loss of trees</h2>
		<p>Many hedges have trees embedded with them; while the hedge is cut back, the tree is left to grow. However, at some point, the tree within the hedge will die, and thanks to mechanical cutting methods, there won't be any ready replacement trees to take its place. But as the change happens only one tree at a time, it isn't noticed as a general trend.</p>
		<p>The same process is at work in tree-lined streets. When a tree is cut down, for whatever reason, it is not always replaced. When this happens, people who know the street will be aware of the change, but it will only be one tree. If twenty trees are lost over a longer period, it is very difficult to notice the change.</p>
		<p>When gradual change is hardly noticed by people in an area where it is happening, it is not surprising that many people do not believe that climate change is happening, or if it is - that it is benign in its effects.</p>
		<p>The problem with change is that it is measured by its effects, and therefore it can't be known until it has already happened.</p>
