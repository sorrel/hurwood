			<h1>Indigo's<em class="title"> Book Review</em></h1>
			<div class="infotext">Page last updated on the 14th of August 2003</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>Indigo has decided to share a few of her favourite books with you. While she can't yet read, she very much enjoys books being read to her.</p>
		<p>Her choice of books, however, has been mostly determined by the pictures found within them.</p>

		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="indigo2_2.jpg" width="175" height="233" alt="Toffee takes a nap cover" /><p class="infotext caption">Toffee finds sleep a problem</p></div>
		<h2><em>Toffee's Night Noises</em> by Sally Chambers</h2> 
		<p>Indigo enjoys the adventures of Toffee, the cat who shares her interests in having naps, making new friends with small animals, and staying up all night being worried by unusual noises.</p>
		<p>During her favourite part of the book Indigo likes hearing about when "<em>Toffee climbs the tree after he hears the banging crashing whallop! noise</em>".</p>
		<p>Indigo also enjoys <em>Toffee takes a nap</em>, and sympathises with Toffee's inability to find peace in his noisey garden. She likes the drawings in both books, particularly the bees in <em>Toffee takes a nap</em>. Indigo also has the remaining books in the sequence: <em>Toffee in Trouble</em>, and <em>Toffee's New Friend</em>. She wishes there were more books about Toffee.</p>
		
		
		<div class="fig list"><img class="picture" src="indigo2_3.jpg" width="175" height="234" alt="My Many Coloured Days cover" /><p class="infotext caption">Indigo enjoys the art of this book</p></div> 
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="indigo2_4.jpg" width="175" height="233" alt="Wolf" /><p class="infotext caption">The Wolf Howls</p></div> 
		<h2><em>My Many Coloured Days</em> by Dr. Seuss</h2> 
		<p>This contains a sweet little poem, but one that doesn't talk down to children. When coupled with the full-page illustrations it makes a very dramatic depiction of changing moods. It was first published in the 1990s, with the pictures created to accompany the text twenty years after the lines were written.</p>
		<p>Particularly effective are the <em>cool green fish</em>, and the <em>buzzy bees</em>. And of course: <em>The Wolf</em>! The Wolf contains Indigo's favourite lines:</p>
		<p><em>Then come my black days.<br/>Mad.<br/>And Loud.<br/>I howl.<br/>I growl at every cloud</em></p>
		<p>Indigo says about it "<em>I like the horsey in it! And the wolf, I like the wolf!</em>". As usual, Indigo likes the things that also slightly frighten her.</p>
		<p>Indigo likes poems very much, and enjoys making her own rhyming words, particularly words that rhyme with "<em>Namister</em>", her favourite made up non-word.</p>
		
		<div class="fig list"><img class="picture" src="indigo2_5.jpg" width="175" height="233" alt="Ladybird books" /><p class="infotext caption">A typical ladybird book</p></div> 
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="indigo2_6.jpg" width="175" height="233" alt="Lambkin picture" /><p class="infotext caption">Lambkin eats some dinner</p></div> 
		<h2>Many Different <em>Ladybird Books</em></h2> 
		<p>Indigo likes the tersely versed Ladybird books mostly written by A.J. McGregor. Mostly published between 1940 and 1960 these books now show their age in the subject matter they address. However, we don't have a problem with 1950s morals every once in a while.</p>	
		<p>Their advantage (apart from the price - they can be found in most second half bookshops for under 50p each) lies in the length of story, and strictly rhyming verse. The rhythm of the words lends itself very well to reading aloud, and makes the experience more entertaining for reader as well as listener (at least, we hope it does).</p>
		<p>Indigo's favourite character is <em>Lambin</em>, shown here tucking into her dinner during <em>Bunny's First Birthday</em>. As the books says:</p>
		<p><em>Bunnies at their lettuce salad<br/>Crunched and munched with shinning eyes;<br/>Golden buttercups for Lambkin<br/>Made her stare in glad surprise.</em></p>
		
		<div class="fig list"><img class="picture" src="indigo2_8.jpg" width="300" height="246" alt="Little Fern's first Winter" /><p class="infotext caption">The Rabbits are surprised by snow</p></div> 
		<h2><em>Little Fern's First Winter</em> by Jane Simmons</h2> 
		<p>For quite some time this was Indigo's favourite book. It features the adventures of <em>Fern </em> and <em>Bracken</em> as they experience their first snowstorm.</p>
		<p>As with many children's books, this arctic encounter results in one of them getting lost, and Fern has to dig through the snow to find Bracken. All ends safely as they curl down safely back in their burrow with their Mummy.</p>
		<p>When asked why she likes this book so much Indigo says "<em>It's got Fern and Bracken in it!</em>", and wishes there were more books about the adventurous rabbits.</p>
		<p>We made up a song about Fern and Bracken, which Indigo likes to sing to the tune of <em>Fr√®re Jacques</em>:</p>
		<p><em>Fern and Bracken, Fern and Bracken<br/>They are friends, they are friends<br/>Both of them have big ears, both of them have big ears<br/>And no fears, and no fears</em></p>
		
		<div class="fig list"><img class="picture" src="indigo2_7.jpg" width="200" height="153" alt="Walrus Picture" /><p class="infotext caption">A Polar Animal, yesterday</p></div> 
		<h2><em>Polar Animals</em> by Paul Hess</h2> 
		<p>Indigo also enjoys factual books, with <em>Polar Animals</em> being one of her early favourites. On the globe the first place she points to is the North Pole saying "<em>Polar Bears</em>", then pointing to the South Pole saying "<em>Penguins</em>".</p>
		<p>Indigo wanted the Walrus picture here "<em>Because it's got Tusks!</em>" (and probably because it frightens her a little), but likes all the Polar Animals, especially the <em>Sea Lions</em> and <em>Seals</em>.</p>
		<p>Indigo also likes books about <em>Farms</em>, and <em>Topsy and Tim</em> books about daily chores. Topsy and Tim books are good as they tend to constantly emphasise correct behaviour at all times!</p> 
		
		<div class="fig list"><img class="picture" src="indigo2_9.jpg" width="175" height="224" alt="Bush baby picture" /><p class="infotext caption">A Bush-Baby at night</p></div> 
		<h2><em>Small Animals</em>, a picture book</h2> 
		<p>Indigo has a few photography books, but is always drawn back to <em>Small Animals</em>, though not for exactly the best reasons. She is fascinated by this picture of the <em>Bush-Baby at Night</em>, and will look at it to such an extent that we had to remove the book from her, and hide it.</p>
		<p>While we hoped this book would lead to a love for baby rabbits and other lagomorphs and rodents, it has instead led to a greater interest (and fear of) eyes staring out of the dark. Indigo said "<em>I like the dark, and the eyes, I like the eyes.</em>" when asked about why she liked this book so much.</p>
		<p>Hopefully when Indigo next encounters the book she will find other pictures of small animals of interest. We don't hold out much hope for that soon...</p>
