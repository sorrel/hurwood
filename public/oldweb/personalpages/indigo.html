		<p>Indigo would this time like to present a few of her favourite dogs. Dogs are now her very favourite things ever: she's offically mad on dogs.</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="indigo6_6.jpg" width="400" height="305" alt="Pic of Puppy Love" /><p class="infotext caption">Indigo's favourite book</p></div>
<h2>Puppy Love</h2>
<p>Indigo particularly likes the book <em>Puppy Love</em> at the moment, as it features several puppies, and their stories.
</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>

<p>Beyond books, Indigo has gathered together a few of her favourite dogs on this page, and hopes to share a few things about them with you.
</p>
<p>She has also written her first story, called <em>Dogs on the Launch</em>, which is presented further down the page.
</p>
<p>Indigo would like to add that she likes dogs because they're pretty, and because some of them are spotty. She also particularly likes spaniels.

<h2>Pongo</h2>
<p>Pongo is a <em>Dalmatian</em>. Dalmation's are Indigo's favourite breed of dog because they're spotty.
</p>
<p>This one has a puppy, called <em>Lucky</em>, and he can be seen in the picture of Indigo with all her most favourite dogs, towards the left.
</p>
<h2>Sizzle</h2>
<p>Sizzle is Indigo's absolute favourite of all. He's soft, and he's quite friendly. He's a sausage dog.
</p>
<p>He jumps at at you when you stroke him, even though he's only a toy.
</p>

<h2>Patio</h2>
<p>He's the lying down one. He's called <em>Patio</em> because he likes to be patted. He's got two patches over his eyes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>
		<div class="fig"><img class="picture" src="indigo6_4.jpg" width="400" height="299" alt="Pic of Patio" /><p class="infotext caption">Patio</p></div>
<h2>Rascal</h2>
<p>He's a <em>Beagle</em>. He likes to chew bones. He likes to be patted as well.
</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>

<p>&nbsp</p>
<h2>Indigo's Story</h2>	
<p>When asked for some more contribution towards her web-page, Indigo said she would write a story. She said it would be called <em>Dogs on the Launch</em>. No-one is quite sure, and the writer can't remember, quite why the word launch is in the title; but that is the title, and the word is staying there!
</p>
<p>So, without further ado, here is Indigo's first story.</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>
<h2>Dogs on the Launch</h2>
<p>
Once upon a time a dog named Caroline went to Dog School. A Dog named Hurwood lived at number 28 and went to school as well.
</p>
<p>
A cat named Charley went to school as well. They all had a big kufullfle-ruffle type of thing.
</p>
<p>
The cat was arguing so much he nearly fell over. The dog didn't want to go to school ever. So they never went to school again.
</p>

<h3>The End.</h3>
<p>&nbsp</p>
<p>And that concludes the story, and also concludes Indigo's page.</p>
