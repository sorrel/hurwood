		<p>This page describes the recent update of this site. The previous version of the this page, describing the design, and the decision to write it in XHTML can be found in the <a class="textlink" href="aboutthesite.html">Archive</a> on the menu.</p>

		<h2>Standards</h2>
		<p>I've tried again to ensure the site is XHTML 1.0 strict, and uses a style sheet that adheres to the standards. I also strongly recommend that anyone using Internet Explorer downloads <a class="textlink" href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Firefox</a> and uses that instead.</p>
		<p>For this version of the site, I have stopped trying to keep all graphical files down to the smallest possible size. Most people I know now have a broadband connection, and if this sample is representative of the population at large, there is no need to keep images belong 25k per file.</p>
		<h2>HTML Editors</h2>
		<p>The previous website had been written with the help of a HTML Editor called <a class="textlink" href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/homesite/">Homesite 4</a>. The current version of Homesite is 5.5, but I was unable to use this for two reasons.</p>
		<p>Firstly, upgrading or buying a new version of Homesite costs money, and I didn't want to spend money on what is essentially a glorified text editor with syntax highlighting. Secondly, I no longer had a PC, and Homesite is not available for the <a class="textlink" href="http://www.apple.com/uk/">Apple Mac</a>.</p>
		<p>I don't like <em>emacs</em>, or other multi-purpose editors very much as I find them far too involved for straightforward tasks, as they have so many options and configuration files. I also looked at some commerical editors such as <a class="textlink" href="http://www.xhtmlsoft.com/">SEEdit</a>, or <a class="textlink" href="http://www.optima-system.com/pagespinner/">Page Spinner</a>.</p>
		<p>In the end, though, I used <a class="textlink" href="http://tacosw.com/index.php">Taco</a>, a basic but very easy to use HTML text editor. It does exactly what I want, i.e. syntax highlighting, and it doesn't try to interere with the pages you're writing. The only downside is that it doesn't have any XHTML syntax checking, but the <a class="textlink" href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Validator Page</a> is able to do that.</p>
		<p>For an FTP Program, I used <a class="textlink" href="http://www.rbrowser.com/RBrowserLite/RBrowserLite.html">RBrowser Lite</a>, which does what it ought to.</p>
		<h2>CSS</h2>
		<p>I also looked for a CSS Editor. Previously I had used <a class="textlink" href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/">Top Style</a>, but again this is not available for the Mac. This was more of a loss than Homesite, as it's a very good program.</p>
		<p>I looked at replacing it with <a class="textlink" href="http://www.macrabbit.com/cssedit/">CSSEdit</a>, or the free <a class="textlink" href="http://www.morphon.com/csseditor/index.shtml">Morphon</a> editor. In the end, though, I just used <em>Taco</em> again, even though it didn't have any CSS syntax highlighting.</p>
		<h2>The Style Sheets used on the site</h2>
		<p>I didn't want to make many changes to the style sheets used on the site. The first style sheet I didn't change at all, apart from the addition of some new animals for the page symbols. This was very easy, apart from the IE PNG problem, of which more later.</p>
		<p>The second style sheet I changed slightly. I added the <em>max-width</em> and <em>min-width</em> tags, to get some more control over the look of the finished page. It's a pity that Internet Explorer 6 doesn't support them, so I ended up setting a <em>width</em> tag too. Hopefully I can put it back to auto when IE catches up with everything else. I also changed the colour of the <em>&lt;em&gt;</em> tagged text, if anyone can tell!</p>
		<h2>Browsers: Much Improved</h2>
		<p>The site was built and checked on <a class="textlink" href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> and <a class="textlink" href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Firefox</a> on the Mac. I also tested it with the old version of Internet Explorer (5.0) on the Mac, <a class="textlink" href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>, and IE 5.5 and 6.0. running under Windows.</p>
		<p>Generally I found the standards of the browsers to be much better than a few years ago, with standards applied in a much better way than previously. (A big hello to any <a class="textlink" href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/netscape/">Netscape 4</a> users out there!)</p>
		<h2>Apart from <em>Internet Explorer</em></h2>
		<p>I can't begin to describe how annoying <a class="textlink" href="http://mrclay.org/web_design/believe/">IE 6</a> is when trying to use XHTML and style sheets. Ignoring the way they tend to ignore the standards and head off into their own set of selectors, the lack of support for CSS2 items like <a class="textlink" href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_reference.asp">max-width</a> is very frustrating. And don't get me started about <a class="textlink" href="http://www.neilturner.me.uk/2003/Apr/12/png_transparency_in_ie.html">PNG transparency</a>. <em>Aaaaaarrgggh</em>!</p>
		<h2>The solutions used on this site</h2>
		<p>I spent quite a while looking for a solution to the IE PNG transparency problem. Solutions I tried included the following sites:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><a class="textlink" href="http://www.koivi.com/ie-png-transparency/">http://www.koivi.com/ie-png-transparency/</a></li>
		<li><a class="textlink" href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/bobosola/">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/bobosola/</a></li>
		<li><a class="textlink" href="http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/pngbehavior/pngbehavior.html">http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/pngbehavior/pngbehavior.html</a></li>
		<li><a class="textlink" href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/pngopacity/">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/pngopacity/</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>While some of the above sites were very good, I couldn't get the solution to work with the way I implement images within style-sheets. Finally, I did find a solution, the <a class="textlink" href="http://www.youngpup.net/">Young Pup</a> website. The full solution url is: <a class="textlink" href="http://www.youngpup.net/2001/sleight">http://www.youngpup.net/2001/sleight</a>.</p>
		<p>I don't like spending my time trying to fix problems in browsers, and hope this is the last time I have spend time worrying about this kind of issue.</p>
		<h2>Work To Be Done</h2>
		<p>This site is made up of a number of older sites, going back to 1999. Most of the older sites don't adhere to the W3C standards, and only this one uses CSS.I'm not going to make the older sites adhere to the current standards.</p>
		<p>The work to be done depends on the new version of IE, whenever it arrives. Hopefully, at that point there will be no need for any hacks, and standard compliant XHTML will "just work" on all browsers.</p>
