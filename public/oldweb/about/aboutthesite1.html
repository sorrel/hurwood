			<h1><em class="title">About</em> the site</h1>
			<div class="infotext">Page last updated on the 1st of July 2003</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>This page describes the motivations behind this website, and links to a few places that those also writing web pages may find interesting.</p>
		<h2>Why am I here?</h2>
		<p>This site was created for two reasons:</p>
		<ul><li>To let people who don't see us very often have a glimpse of what we're doing.</li>
		<li>To improve our web programming skills.</li></ul>
		<p>In particular, this site has been updated recently to take advantage of <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>. While looking at them, I discovered that quite a few things had changed in the four years since I last read a book on <em>HTML</em>.</p>
		<h2>Main Information Sources</h2>
		<p>I'd been planning to use Cascading Style Sheets (usually shortened to <em>CSS</em>) for quite a while, but with so many web-standards to catch up on, knowing where to start presented a bit of a challenge.</p> 
		<p>After looking at a number of books on the subject I decided that the best source of information was the actual <em>source</em> of the information: The <a class="textlink" href="http://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium</a>. The <a class="textlink" href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">W3C website</a> is the home of the specifications of the languages used in the making of webpages.</p>
		<p>With so much information to make sense from, what is really needed is a guide page, which thankfully the W3C have provided at <a class="textlink" href="http://www.w3.org/2002/03/new-to-w3c">www.w3.org/2002/03/new-to-w3c</a>.</p>
		<h3>My recommended W3C starting points:</h3>
		<ul>
		<li><a class="textlink" href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/">Basic HTML Tutorial</a>, without this the web just wouldn't be the same.</li>
		<li><a class="textlink" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML Specification Document</a>,  HTML now has an additional X-factor.</li>
		<li><a class="textlink" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/">CSS Specification Document</a>, reading the spec is the best tutorial around.</li>
		<li><a class="textlink" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html">The CSS Box Model</a>, understanding this section of the spec is crucial.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Once I felt I had a good understanding of CSS syntax, the real work began: putting the information to work in a practical way.</p>
		<h2>Using CSS</h2>
		<p>Trying to just list the <em>number</em> of sites offering hints and tips on using CSS is a mammoth task, and one I certainly won't attempt here. Listed below are a few of the sites I consulted; all were useful in some way, and have described techniques that I have adapted for this site.</p>
		<h3>Web design sites I found useful:</h3>
		<ul>
		<li><a class="textlink" href="http://www.webmasterworld.com/category10.htm">www.WebMasterWorld.com</a>, the best web discussion forum.</li>
		<li><a class="textlink" href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/">A List Apart</a>, an excellent site for friendly top tips.</li>
		<li><a class="textlink" href="http://www.glish.com/css/">CSS Column Layouts</a>, there are many great websites showing how to setup columns, this being one.</li>
		</ul> 
		<h2>Browsers</h2>
		<p>I've tried to make sure that this site functions correctly on all four modern browsers (Netscape, Internet Explorer, Opera and Mozilla). In addition to that, I also wanted to make sure that it worked well and was legible if either Javascript or Style Sheets were turned off.</p>  
		<p>The most annoying problem was to make sure the page was readable using Netscape Navigator 4,and that the CSS validated at the same time. On all the pages except this one I list the two style sheets both as "<em>alternate stylesheet</em>", which NN4 will ignore; on this page I have one described as just a "<em>stylesheet</em>" as the validator searches for a <em>prefered</em> stylesheet, which is written as just "<em>stylesheet</em>". I added some javascript to ensure that NN4 automatically uses a different (empty) style sheet, and doesn't pick the main one, which it wouldn't be able to handle.</p> 
		<h2>Validation</h2>
		<p>The W3C provide some very useful tools to validate that a website is built to the correct specifications. Below are two buttons that can be used to test* whether this page has the syntax that it claims to have:</p> 
		<p><a href="http://validator.w3.org/check/referer"><img style="border:0px;" src="http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10" alt="Valid XHTML 1.0!" height="31" width="88"/></a>
		<a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer"> &nbsp;&nbsp;<img style="border:0px;" src="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss" alt="Valid CSS!"/></a></p>
		<h2>Other Resources</h2>
		<p>Another couple of places I'd recommend having a look at are:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><a class="textlink" href="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/">Webmonkey</a>, on one of the oldest websites are some useful tutorials.</li>
		<li><a class="textlink" href="http://www.david-little.org.uk">David Little's Site</a>, read the weblog for links to recent articles.</li>
		<li><a class="textlink" href="http://www.csszengarden.com">CSS ZenGarden</a>, shows you what can be done (if you're a graphic designer).</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="infotext">*Actually, I have cheated a bit. For this page only I have created a version of the original style sheet that does not use Microsoft proprietory scroll bar alterations, as those of you with Internet Explorer browsers may notice. These are not part of normal CSS, and shouldn't really be used.</div>
