		<p>The <em>Hurwood Family Website</em> has been around since 1998. Since that time there have been a number of different versions, some of which are presented here.</p>
		
<h2>January 2005</h2>
		<p>The title drawing has recently been retired.</p>
<p>The previous one, which lasted throughout 2003 and 2004, is shown below:</p>
<div class="mainpicture"></div>

<h2>October 2002</h2>
		<p>The last update of the site before the current design was the Autumn of 2002. A new pictured showed Asher in in his at-the-time favoured crawling position. The photographs were all taken at the Longleat Doctor Who open day. In keeping with the style of the previous web, everyone was interviewed by another member of the family.</p>
		<p>The Autumn 2002 edition can be found <a class="textlink" href="../October02/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>July 2002</h2>
		<p>For the summer of 2002 we increased the colourfulness of the drawings, while retaining the black background. Asher had a page for the first time, and Indigo took part in her first interview. </p>
		<p>The complete summer 2002 edition can be found <a class="textlink" href="../July02/index.html">here</a>.</p>
		
<h2>October 2001</h2>
		<p>This website is taken from the 26th of October 2001, when Asher was only four days old. There wasn't much time to update things for him (and he didn't have many opinions anyway) so he isn't included. What remains is the opinions of the other members of the household from July and September.</p>
		<p>The October 2001 website can be found <a class="textlink" href="../October01/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>July 2001</h2>
		<p>After some time off trying to get to cope with parenthood the website returned in 2001. For the first time Indigo got her own page, featuring a photo from our ill-fated attempt at a holiday in Devon in the summer of 2001. The backdrop to the website was made dark, to allow the drawings to seem more colourful and vibrant. As usual, Heidi is pregnant.</p>
		<p>The first post-Indigo website can be seen <a class="textlink" href="../July01/index.html">here</a>.</p>		
		
<h2>January 2000</h2>
		<p>For the year 2000 we tried to move towards a slightly sleeker design for the front page. Heidi was pregnant with Indigo, and the happy-go-lucky days were clearly behing us! In this version the sunshine to the right can be clicked on to access some of our wedding photos.</p>
		<p>The Millennium edition can be found <a class="textlink" href="../Jan00/index.htm">here</a>.</p>

<h2>June 1999</h2>
		<p>The first website was begun in late 1998, while I was a student at <a class="textlink" href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/about/">the University of Bath</a>. Javascript rollovers were the in-thing of the time, so we had one too. Less effective was the transfer of the drawings featuring my family (and animals) into web-graphics, though they do have a charm all of their own. The only change to the site is that the links for Richard Dawkins and Chico Mendes have been updated.</p>
<p>Extracts from the site can be found <a class="textlink" href="../June99/index.htm">here</a>.</p>
