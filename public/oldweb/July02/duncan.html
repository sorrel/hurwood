<br>I'm currently reading <font color="#F75C46">Fast Food Nation</font>, by <font color="#F75C46">Eric Schlosser</font>.
Other than that I'm looking forward to the new <font color="#F75C46">Tom Stoppard</font> plays, which come out in August.
</p>
<p>
<font size="+1" color="#FF8040">Football</font>
<br>The <font color="#F75C46">World Cup</font> was fun, but better at the beginning than the end. I was happy
to see <font color="#F75C46">France</font>, <font color="#F75C46">Italy</font> and <font color="#F75C46">Portugal</font> fail 
so badly, and happy to see <font color="#F75C46">Korea</font> and the <font color="#F75C46">USA</font> do so well.
I wasn't that surprised with <font color="#F75C46">England</font>'s performance, but it was ok. My other team, 
<font color="#F75C46">Brighton and Hove Albion</font> are
spending the Summer without a manager, which must be saving them a few quid.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1" color="#FF8040">Games</font>
<br>I've been selling all my old consoles and games (against the wishes of Ebay, who seem to want to
keep closing my auctions). Instead we've been playing <font color="#F75C46">German Board Games</font> like
<font color="#F75C46">Carcassone</font> and <font color="#F75C46">The Settlers of Catan</font>. 
It makes a very nice change, although I would like to play a few more computer or console games when the new
systems have settled down a bit. Of the three consoles out at the moment 
I'd prefer to have a go at the <font color="#F75C46">GameCube</font>.</p>
